              When individuals embark on a major investment in their housing, they hope for a professional quote. Therefore, be sure to write in understandable French. Don't offer ridiculously low rates. Do not use the argument of the fees of Bricoly in relation to the connection in response to an individual. Your quotes must be clear and include VAT and the method of payment.

              The most important thing is to provide high quality work. Do not accept projects that you cannot carry out. Finish your work cleanly and do not abandon the work in progress. A problem may arise and cause a complaint. It is very important to settle this correctly with the individual. Can't seem to find common ground? We are at your disposal.
